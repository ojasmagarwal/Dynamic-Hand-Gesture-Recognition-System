# Dynamic-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-System

->  Constructed a real‑time gesture recognition system with 90% accuracy.
• Proposed method can successfully detect the hand of the user and recognize the gesture from a live camera feed.
• Employed Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow for image pre‑processing and model training.
• Developed system enables more intuitive human‑computer interaction and has versatile applications.
