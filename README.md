# Dynamic-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-System

+ Constructed a real‑time gesture recognition system with 90% accuracy.

* Proposed method can successfully detect the hand of the user and recognize the gesture from a live camera feed.

* It can detect the following words ['okay', 'peace', 'thumbs up', 'thumbs down', 'call me', 'stop', 'rock', 'live long', 'fist', 'smile']
- Employed Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow for image pre‑processing and model training.
* Developed system enables more intuitive human‑computer interaction and has versatile applications.
